# HTTML and CSS projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS

## Projects  
* One Page Webpage  
* General Webpage  

**One Page Webpage**  
This page has some silly custome images that were made for the use of this page. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
**General Webpage**  
This is an example of a basic webpage styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.
